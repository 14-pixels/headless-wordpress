## Development

### Environments and Primary Branches

- [WP Engine Prod](https://nextjs.wpengine.com/wp-admin/) - `main` branch - Manual releases only
- [WP Engine Dev](https://nextjsdevstart.wpengine.com/wp-admin/) - `develop` branch - Auto deploy [via Buddy](https://app.buddy.works/webdevstudios/wds-headless-wordpress/pipelines)

### Git Workflow

1. Create a `feature` branch off `main`
2. Work locally adhering to coding standards
3. Merge your `feature` into `develop` to test on [WPE Dev environment](https://nextjsdevstart.wpengine.com/wp-admin/)
4. When your `feature` has been tested on WPE Dev, open a Pull Request (PR) and fill out the PR template
5. Your PR must pass assertions
6. After peer review, the PR will be merged back into `main`
7. Repeat ‚ôªÔ∏è

### Code Linting

This project uses PHPCS via Composer to enforce standards both [WebDevStudios](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/php-coding-standards) and [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/).

Lint PHP with phpcs:

```bash
composer run lint
```

Format PHP with phpcbf:

```bash
composer run format
```

Check compatability:

```bash
composer run compat
```

### Tips to help your PR get approved

1. Make sure your code editor supports real-time linting and has the PHPCS extension installed
2. [PHP DocBlocks](https://docs.phpdoc.org/latest/guide/guides/docblocks.html) are required
3. Run `composer run lint` before submitting your PR
4. Be courteous in your communications
